# Object preamble

use Bio::DB::PersistentObjectI;
use Bio::Ontology::Term;

@ISA = qw(Bio::DB::BioSQL::BasePersistenceAdaptor);


=head2 new

 Title   : new
 Usage   :
 Function: Instantiates the persistence adaptor.
 Example :
 Returns : 
 Args    :


=cut

sub new{
   my ($class,@args) = @_;

   # we want to enable object caching
   push(@args, "-cache_objects", 1) unless grep { /cache_objects/i; } @args;
   my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@args);

   return $self;
}


=head2 get_persistent_slots

 Title   : get_persistent_slots
 Usage   :
 Function: Get the slots of the object that map to attributes in its respective
           entity in the datastore.

           Slots should be methods callable without an argument.

 Example :
 Returns : an array of method names constituting the serializable slots
 Args    : the object about to be inserted or updated


=cut

sub get_persistent_slots{
    my ($self,@args) = @_;

    return ("identifier", "name", "definition");
}

=head2 get_persistent_slot_values

 Title   : get_persistent_slot_values
 Usage   :
 Function: Obtain the values for the slots returned by get_persistent_slots(),
           in exactly that order.

           The reason this method is here is that sometimes the actual slot
           values need to be post-processed to yield the value that gets
           actually stored in the database. E.g., slots holding arrays
           will need some kind of join function applied. Another example is if
           the method call needs additional arguments. Supposedly the
           adaptor for a specific interface knows exactly what to do here.

           Since there is also populate_from_row() the adaptor has full
           control over mapping values to a version that is actually stored.
 Example :
 Returns : A reference to an array of values for the persistent slots of this
           object. Individual values may be undef.
 Args    : The object about to be serialized.
           A reference to an array of foreign key objects if not retrievable 
           from the object itself.


=cut

sub get_persistent_slot_values {
    my ($self,$obj,$fkobjs) = @_;
    my @vals = ($obj->identifier(),
		$obj->name(),
		$obj->definition()
		);
    return \@vals;
}

=head2 get_foreign_key_objects

 Title   : get_foreign_key_objects
 Usage   :
 Function: Gets the objects referenced by this object, and which therefore need
           to be referenced as foreign keys in the datastore.

           Note that the objects are expected to implement
           Bio::DB::PersistentObjectI.

           An implementation may obtain the values either through the object
           to be serialized, or through the additional arguments. An
           implementation should also make sure that the order of foreign key
           objects returned is always the same.

           Note also that in order to indicate a NULL value for a nullable
           foreign key, either put an object returning undef from 
           primary_key(), or put the name of the class instead. DO NOT SIMPLY
           LEAVE IT OUT.

 Example :
 Returns : an array of Bio::DB::PersistentObjectI implementing objects
 Args    : The object about to be inserted or updated, or undef if the call
           is for a SELECT query. In the latter case return class or interface
           names that are mapped to the foreign key tables.
           Optionally, additional named parameters. A common parameter will
           be -fkobjs, with a reference to an array of foreign key objects
           that are not retrievable from the persistent object itself.

=cut

sub get_foreign_key_objects{
    my ($self,$obj,$fkobjs) = @_;
    my $cat;

    if(ref($obj) && $obj->category()) {
	$cat = $obj->category();
	$cat->foreign_key_slot(ref($self)."::category");
    } else {
	$cat = ref($self)."::category";
    }
    return ($cat);
}

=head2 attach_foreign_key_objects

 Title   : attach_foreign_key_objects
 Usage   :
 Function: Attaches foreign key objects to the given object as far as
           necessary.

           This method is called after find_by_XXX() queries, not for INSERTs
           or UPDATEs.

 Example :
 Returns : TRUE on success, and FALSE otherwise.
 Args    : The object to which to attach foreign key objects.
           A reference to an array of foreign key values, in the order of
           foreign keys returned by get_foreign_key_objects().


=cut

sub attach_foreign_key_objects{
    my ($self,$obj,$fks) = @_;
    my $ok = 1;
    
    if($fks && @$fks) {
	# the foreign key to category is optional
	if($fks->[0]) {
	    if(my $cat_term = $self->find_by_primary_key($fks->[0])) {
		$obj->category($cat_term);
	    } else {
		$ok = 0;
	    }
	}
    }
    return $ok;
}

=head2 instantiate_from_row

 Title   : instantiate_from_row
 Usage   :
 Function: Instantiates the class this object is an adaptor for, and populates
           it with values from columns of the row.

           This implementation call populate_from_row() to do the real job.
 Example :
 Returns : An object, or undef, if the row contains no values
 Args    : A reference to an array of column values. The first column is the
           primary key, the other columns are expected to be in the order 
           returned by get_persistent_slots().
           Optionally, the object factory to be used for instantiating the
           proper class. The adaptor must be able to instantiate a default
           class if this value is undef.


=cut

sub instantiate_from_row{
    my ($self,$row,$fact) = @_;
    my $obj;

    if($row && @$row) {
	if($fact) {
	    $obj = $fact->create_object();
	} else {
	    $obj = Bio::Ontology::Term->new();
	}
	$self->populate_from_row($obj, $row);
    }
    return $obj;
}

=head2 populate_from_row

 Title   : populate_from_row
 Usage   :
 Function: Instantiates the class this object is an adaptor for, and populates
           it with values from columns of the row.

 Example :
 Returns : An object, or undef, if the row contains no values
 Args    : The object to be populated.
           A reference to an array of column values. The first column is the
           primary key, the other columns are expected to be in the order 
           returned by get_persistent_slots().


=cut

sub populate_from_row{
    my ($self,$obj,$rows) = @_;

    if(! ref($obj)) {
	$self->throw("\"$obj\" is not an object. Probably internal error.");
    }
    if($rows && @$rows) {
	$obj->identifier($rows->[1]) if $rows->[1];
	$obj->name($rows->[2]) if $rows->[2];
	$obj->definition($rows->[3]) if $rows->[3];
	if($obj->isa("Bio::DB::PersistentObjectI")) {
	    $obj->primary_key($rows->[0]);
	}
	return $obj;
    }
    return undef;
}

=head2 get_unique_key_query

 Title   : get_unique_key_query
 Usage   :
 Function: Obtain the suitable unique key slots and values as determined by the
           attribute values of the given object and the additional foreign
           key objects, in case foreign keys participate in a UK. 

 Example :
 Returns : A reference to a hash with the names of the object''s slots in the
           unique key as keys and their values as values.
 Args    : The object with those attributes set that constitute the chosen
           unique key (note that the class of the object will be suitable for
           the adaptor).
           A reference to an array of foreign key objects if not retrievable 
           from the object itself.


=cut

sub get_unique_key_query{
    my ($self,$obj,$fkobjs) = @_;
    my $uk_h = {};

    # UKs for ontology terms are identifier and (name,category)
    if($obj->identifier()) {
	$uk_h->{'identifier'} = $obj->identifier();
    } elsif($obj->name()) {
	$uk_h->{'name'} = $obj->name();
	if(my $cat = $obj->category()) {
	    if($cat->isa("Bio::DB::PersistentObjectI")) {
		$cat->store() unless $cat->primary_key();
	    } else {
		$cat = $self->find_by_unique_key($cat);
	    }
	    $uk_h->{'category'} = $cat->primary_key() if $cat;
	}
    }
    
    return $uk_h;
}
